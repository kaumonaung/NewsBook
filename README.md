# NewsBook

This is a small app that uses the free tier of [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch news articles. It has a very simple custom textfield that allows users to search for specific topics, and shows a detail view of each article with the full text (if not on the free tier).

## Learning Review
This small project is part of my journey to learn Swift and SwiftUI. The following list introduces the key topics in learning by creating this app.

- Calling an API and decode the JSON objects to Swift objects
- Creating a custom class to load remote url images into SwiftUI
- Using `NavigtionView` and `NavigtionLink` to create an Article Detail View
